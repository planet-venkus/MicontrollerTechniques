# MicontrollerTechniques
This repository contains the lab work implemented as part of Microcontroller Techniques Course at Uni Freiburg.

The entire coursework was implemented using Embedded C and tested with Texas Instrument MSP430G2553 development board. The documentation of all the components used in the development board can be found in **Datasheets** folder. 

Softwares:
1. Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio
2. Terminal for Serial Interface: Hterm
