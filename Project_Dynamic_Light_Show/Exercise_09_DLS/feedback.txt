Exercise No: 09
Topic: Dynamic light show

Implemented features:
1. controlling the speed and direction of the LED running light including D1 to D4.
2. setting the brightness of the red, green and blue LED using pulse-width modulation.
3. setting various LED effects such as constant illumination, blinking and breathing for the red, green and blue LED by appropriately controlling the pulse-width modulation.

Not implemented: 
1. implement a mode in which the brightness is controlled by the ambient light level



Feedback:
1. It was a very interesting exercise. It took me time to implement the timer part of the problem. Learning to use both the timers was a great learning.
2. I tried all the ways to metigate the polling problem of running two timers parallely but it was a learning failure. 
3. The push buttons were quite unreliable and made it really difficult while testing the implemented code.
