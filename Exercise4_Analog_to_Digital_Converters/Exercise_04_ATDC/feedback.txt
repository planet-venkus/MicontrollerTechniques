Thanks for the previous feedbacks and answers on ILIAS forum, it helped me very much through the exercise.
Exercise gave a good insight about the usage of Analog to Digital Converter.

Specific problems:
1. I find Blue LED to be working in reverse logic (i.e, ON when connected to ground and OFF when connected to +5V).
2. Testing for Bonus part was difficult as we didnt have chips for Yellow, Cyan and Magenta.
3. Used different materials like paper/ plastic cap for testing the other colour LID as this affected the range setting
