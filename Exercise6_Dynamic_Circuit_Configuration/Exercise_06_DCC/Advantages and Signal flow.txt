Advantages compared to readout structure:
1. Interrupt is used over polling. The Microcontroller executes the ISR when there is a tap rather than executing in loop(polling).
2. There is a feedback(Red Light) on sensing the tap.
3. The sensitivity can be adjusted by using potentiometer.

Analog Front End circuit signal flow:
1. The Buzzer is connected to the DAC_IN through a Buffer stage.
2. The Buffer stage isolates the load from the input. The properties of Buffer stage are high input impedence and low output impedence.
3. The second stage of Analog front end is comparator.
4. When Input voltage < Reference voltage, output is Vss of Operational Amplifier. when Input voltage > Reference voltage, output is Vcc of Operational amplifier.
5. The Potentiometer which connected to inverting terminal of operational amplifier(reference to schematic in Board Schematic.pdf, page 4), allows
   range reference voltage to be selected between 0v anSd 3.3v.
