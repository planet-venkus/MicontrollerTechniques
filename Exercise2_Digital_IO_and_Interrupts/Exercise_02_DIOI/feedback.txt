Feedback:
o Thank you for the feedback from exercise 1. It helped me improve the quality of my code and submission.
o Positive Remarks: The exercise gave a very good insight about polling, interrupt and ISR
o Issues: 
1. Initally i felt it difficult to understand the use case of interrupts. 
2. Also understanding the initialization of Port 1 as interrupt was diffcult. Documentation solved these issues.
3. I couldnt figure out why setting P1.0 was turning OFF the connected BLUE LED.
o Additional requests: None
