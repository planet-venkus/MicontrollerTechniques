 *               University of Freiburg
 *
 * Creation:     February 2012
 * Last Changes: June 2015
 *
 * Description:  This is the template for the practical course(s) of
 *               "Mikrocomputertechnik".
 *
 * How to use:   Copy this file into:
 *               <path to code composer installation>\ccs_base\msp430\include\
 *
 *               This is most likely:
 *               C:\Program Files\TI\ccsv6\ccs_base\msp430\include
 *
 *               Include it in your project with:
 *               #include <templateEMP.h>
 *
 *               And initialize it with:
 *               initMSP();
 *
 * Please note:
 *   CodeComposer doesn't feature an easy solution on how to include
 *   libraries (you either have to copy the library into every new project
 *   or have to adjust the linker each time - both not too convenient
 *   for someone who is completely new to programming microcontrollers)
 *   As a simply solution to this we decided to put the code in this headerfile
 *   instead. This is a "not so good practice", but it works.
 *   Students, please note: only put declarations into headerfiles, not code.
 *   (Ironic, isn't it?)
 *
 * Also note that you do not have to understand this file in detail but
 *  should rather understand its comments so that you know what a certain
 *  function does - instead of how.
 *
 * If you want to implement UART on your own, please write
 *   #define NO_TEMPLATE_UART 1
 * right before you include this file.
 *
 * If you want to implement the ISR on your own, but still want to keep the
 * other functions, please write
 *   #define NO_TEMPLATE_ISR 1
 * right before you include this file.
 *
 *
 * Changelog:
 *   0.1: Creation
 *   0.2: Fixed the ring buffer not going in a ring (buffer overflows, yay!).
 *   0.3: Added ifndef-structure to allow users to disable uart completely.
 *        Define NO_TEMPLATE_UART in case you want to write your own
 *        implementation.
 *   0.4: Fixed serialPrintInt as reported by Nessim Ben Ammar.
 *   0.5: General clean up of the code and corrected some comments.
 *   0.6: Fixed some comments and added some more
 *   0.7: It's now possible to use NO_TEMPLATE_ISR to disable the ISR-code
 *        while still maintaining the other serial functions (in case you have/
 *        want to implement your own ISR).
